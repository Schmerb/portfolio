    <h2>Get to know Me</h2>
    <p>I am a fullstack web developer and recent graduate of the Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at Thinkful. From a young age, I have always been inclined to build things and see what I can make. Since coding has come into my life, I have had the opportunity to do just that and create projects from scratch. The feeling of taking an idea and turning it into a fully functional, working application is unparalleled. My technology of choice is the MERN stack and I equally enjoy both frontend and backend development.</p>
    <p>When I am not building stuff, I enjoy piloting my drone and taking videos, catching deep powder on my snowboard, seeing live music, and riding roller coasters.</p>
